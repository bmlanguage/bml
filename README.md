**Write High-Level, Run at Bare Metal Speed.**

Tired of wrestling with cryptic assembly code for your embedded systems?  Do you crave the expressiveness of a modern language without sacrificing the performance and control you need at the metal?

**Introducing Bare Metal Language (BML) - Version 1.5: Your Production-Ready Path to High-Performance, Safe, and Maintainable Embedded Systems.**

BML isn't just another embedded language; it's a **purpose-built replacement for assembly**, meticulously engineered to empower you to:

*   **Achieve Assembly-Level Performance:** BML's compiler is aggressively optimized, leveraging advanced techniques and **Composable Architecture Modules (CAMs)** to generate machine code that rivals hand-optimized assembly, all from high-level source.  Say goodbye to performance compromises.
*   **Embrace Modern Software Engineering:**  Write readable, maintainable, and modular code with BML's clear syntax, static typing, and powerful abstraction capabilities.  Bring modern software engineering practices to your embedded projects.
*   **Mitigate Memory Safety Risks:** BML proactively addresses memory safety with features like `safeArray`, `scopedPtr`, and capability-based pointers, reducing common errors without sacrificing performance.  Build more robust and reliable systems.
*   **Target Multiple Architectures with Ease:**  Write architecture-agnostic code and leverage CAMs for platform-specific optimizations. Compile your BML codebase for ARM, RISC-V, x86, and more, with peak performance on each.
*   **Harness the Power of CAMs:**  Composable Architecture Modules (CAMs) are BML's secret weapon. They are compiler extensions that inject domain-specific optimizations and hardware awareness directly into your code. Build complex systems from reusable, pre-verified, and highly optimized components.

**What's New in Version 1.5 - Production Ready & Feature Complete:**

Version 1.5 marks a significant milestone, solidifying BML as a **production-ready language** and introducing **cutting-edge features** for unparalleled optimization and metaprogramming:

*   **üöÄ Compile-Time Reflection:** Inspect type information *during compilation* using `sizeof()` and `isType()`. CAMs become even smarter and more adaptive.
*   **‚ö° Compile-Time Functions (Static Lambdas):**  Execute code *at compile time* within CAMs using `compileTimeFunction`.  Unlock zero-overhead code specialization and pre-computation.
*   **‚öôÔ∏è Data-Driven Code Generation:**  CAMs now automatically specialize code based on **Data Layout Attributes**.  Optimize performance based on how your data is organized in memory, automatically.

**Key Benefits at a Glance:**

*   **üöÄ Performance Primacy:** Zero-overhead abstractions, aggressive compile-time optimizations, CAM-driven specialization.
*   **üéõÔ∏è Low-Level Control:** Direct hardware interaction, register manipulation, precise timing.
*   **üõ°Ô∏è Memory Safety Mitigation:** `scopedPtr`, `safeArray`, capability-based pointers, static analysis.
*   **üéØ Multi-Target Versatility:** Write once, compile for ARM, RISC-V, x86, and more.
*   **üß© Modularity & Reusability:** CAMs for building complex systems from reusable components.
*   **‚úÖ Readability & Maintainability:** Clear syntax, structured code, easier to understand and evolve.
*   **üõ†Ô∏è Tooling & Debugging:** Designed for source-level debugging and assembly inspection.
*   **üßµ Concurrency & Parallelism:**  Explicit language constructs for multi-core bare metal systems.

**Why BML? Stop Writing Assembly, Start Engineering.**

Assembly language is powerful but notoriously complex, error-prone, and difficult to maintain.  Low-level C, while an improvement, still often requires manual optimization and careful memory management, hindering productivity and increasing the risk of bugs.

**BML solves this dilemma.** It empowers you to write high-level code that compiles down to assembly-level efficiency, eliminating the need for manual assembly in the vast majority of embedded development tasks.  Focus on your system's logic, not the intricacies of machine code.
