**Write High-Level Code, Achieve Bare Metal Speed.**

Are you seeking the expressiveness of modern languages for embedded systems, but constrained by assembly's complexity and lack of maintainability?

**Introducing Bare Metal Language (BML) v1.5: Your Production-Ready Solution for High-Performance, Safe, and Maintainable Embedded Systems Development.**

BML is a purpose-built language meticulously designed as a **direct replacement for assembly**, empowering engineers to:

*   **Maximize Performance:** BML's aggressively optimizing compiler, leveraging **Composable Architecture Modules (CAMs)**, generates machine code rivaling hand-optimized assembly from high-level source. Eliminate performance compromises in embedded systems.
*   **Embrace Modern Practices:** Develop readable, maintainable, and modular embedded code with BML's clear syntax, static typing, and robust abstraction capabilities. Apply modern software engineering principles to your embedded projects.
*   **Enhance Memory Safety:** Proactively mitigate memory safety risks with built-in features like `safeArray`, `scopedPtr`, and capability-based pointers. Build robust and reliable systems, reducing common memory-related errors without performance overhead.
*   **Target Multiple Architectures:** Write architecture-agnostic code and utilize CAMs for platform-specific optimizations. Compile your BML codebase for ARM, RISC-V, x86, and more, achieving peak performance across diverse platforms.
*   **Leverage Composable Architecture Modules (CAMs):** CAMs are BML's core innovation â€“ compiler extensions that inject domain-specific optimizations and hardware awareness directly into your code. Construct complex systems from reusable, pre-verified, and highly optimized components.

## Version 1.5: Production Ready & Feature Complete

BML v1.5 marks a significant step, establishing BML as a **production-ready language** with **advanced features** for unparalleled optimization and metaprogramming capabilities:

*   **Compile-Time Reflection:** Enhance CAMs with compile-time type introspection using `sizeof()` and `isType()`. Enable smarter, more adaptive optimizations based on type information available during compilation.
*   **Compile-Time Functions (Static Lambdas):** Execute code at compile time within CAMs using `compileTimeFunction`. Unlock zero-overhead code specialization and pre-computation, pushing performance boundaries.
*   **Data-Driven Code Generation:** CAMs now automatically specialize code based on **Data Layout Attributes**. Optimize performance automatically by tailoring code generation to your specific data organization in memory.

## Key Benefits

*   **Performance Primacy:** Zero-overhead abstractions, aggressive compile-time optimizations, and CAM-driven specialization deliver exceptional performance.
*   **Low-Level Control:** Direct hardware interaction, register manipulation, and precise timing control for demanding embedded applications.
*   **Memory Safety Focus:** `scopedPtr`, `safeArray`, capability-based pointers, and static analysis tools mitigate memory-related errors.
*   **Multi-Architecture Versatility:** Compile once, deploy across ARM, RISC-V, x86, and other architectures.
*   **Modular & Reusable Components:** CAMs facilitate building complex systems from pre-verified, reusable modules.
*   **Improved Code Quality:** Clear syntax and structured code promote readability, maintainability, and easier evolution of embedded systems.
*   **Enhanced Tooling & Debugging:** Designed for seamless source-level debugging and assembly inspection workflows.
*   **Concurrency & Parallelism Ready:** Explicit language constructs for developing multi-core bare metal systems.

## Why Choose BML? Engineer, Don't Wrestle with Assembly.

While assembly language offers ultimate control, it's notoriously complex, error-prone, and challenging to maintain. Low-level C, while an improvement, often necessitates manual optimization and intricate memory management, impacting productivity and increasing bug risks.

**BML resolves this dilemma.** It empowers you to write high-level code that compiles to assembly-level efficiency, eliminating manual assembly for the vast majority of embedded development tasks. Focus on your system's core logic and innovation, not the complexities of machine code.
